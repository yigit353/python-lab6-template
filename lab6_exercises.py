#
# 4. It should have methods:

#    - get_perimeter(self): returns perimeter (2 × (width + height))
#
# 5. Validation should ensure dimensions are valid geometric values.
#
# Important: Focus on proper encapsulation. The internal representation
# should be hidden, and all interactions should go through the class methods.
#
# Write your Rectangle class below:

#    using a class-level variable named _count.
#
# 2. It should provide a class method named get_instance_count that retrieves 
#    the current count of instances.
#
# 3. It should also provide a static method named is_even(number) that:
#    - Takes a number as parameter
#    - Returns True if the number is even, False otherwise
#    - Does not need access to any instance or class data
#
# Important: Pay attention to which methods should operate on the class
# versus which should be standalone utilities. Use @classmethod and @staticmethod
# decorators appropriately.
# NOTE: get_instance_count MUST work when called from both:
# - the class: Counter.get_instance_count()
# - and an instance: obj.get_instance_count()
#
# Write your Counter class below:

#    - Must use super() to initialize style and material
#    - Adds num_legs instance attribute
#    - Overrides the describe() method to return format:

# - Attribute names for Engine: horsepower
# - Attribute names for Car: brand, engine
#
# Requirements:

#    - start(self) method that returns format:
#      "{brand} car: {engine_activation_string}"
#      where engine_activation_string is the result of calling engine.activate()
#
# The key concept is that the Car HAS-A Engine (composition),
# rather than IS-A Engine (inheritance).
#
# The start() method MUST include the exact result of engine.activate() 
# inside the returned string.

# The exact string formats must match exactly as shown above.
#
# Write both classes below:
